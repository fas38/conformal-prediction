Here we have used Sepsis dataset for evaluating the models. It includes detailed records of patient health metrics and diagnostic information. The dataset encompasses several key variables that are essential for accurate sepsis prediction. The target variable is binary indicating whether the patients had sepsis or not. The dataset is imbalanced, dominated mostly by not sepsis class (label 0) as 897 samples belongs to not sepsis class from total of 995 samples. Before training the machine learning models and using conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification, we have preprocessed the data to ensure that it is clean and ready for analysis. The preprocessing steps include data cleaning, data transformation, and data splitting.

The dataset features a variety of variables that include both continuous and categorical data. Continuous variables such as age, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, lactic acid levels (lacticacid), and white blood cell counts (leucocytes) provide quantitative measures that are critical for monitoring patient health and detecting sepsis. Categorical data includes diagnostic codes (diagnose) and binary flags that indicate whether specific diagnostic tests such as blood cultures (diagnosticblood), ECGs (diagnosticecg), or X-rays (diagnosticxthorax) have been performed. The dataset also contains sequential and timing of medical events and clinical interventions.

The feature "diagnose" contains missing values and to handle this, we have converted all the missing values to a single category called "missing". We have also converted the categorical and boolean features to prepare the dataset for machine learning models. We converted Categorical and Boolean features using label encoder from sklearn to numerical values. 

The continuous variables in the dataset were standardized using the robust scaling method from sklearn. We have chosen robust scaling because it is less sensitive to outliers because it uses the median and interquartile range for scaling.

The dataset was divided into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio to ensure that both subsets are representative of the overall data population. The training set was further divided to create a calibration subset used for uncertainty quantification with conformal prediction. The calibration subset was created by randomly selecting 20% of the training data. The remaining 80% of the training data was used to train the machine learning models. We have also used stratified sampling to ensure that the distribution of the target variable is preserved in training, calibration, and test sets.
